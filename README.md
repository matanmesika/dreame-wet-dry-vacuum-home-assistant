# Dreame Wet & Dry Vacuum — Home Assistant integration

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

A custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for **Dreame wet & dry stick vacuums**, developed and tested against the **Dreame H14 Pro** (`dreame.hold.w2306e`).

It connects to the Dreame cloud, authenticates with your Dreame account, and exposes the device's status, statistics, consumables, alerts and settings as Home Assistant entities. Live state updates are delivered through the cloud **MQTT push** feed, with a periodic web poll as a fallback.

> ⚠️ This is an **unofficial** integration. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Dreame. Use at your own risk. The cloud API is undocumented and may change at any time.

## Features

This is a *wet & dry stick* vacuum (not a robot), so there is **no `vacuum` entity**. Instead the integration exposes the device through standard entity platforms:

### Sensors
- **State** — current activity (mopping, drying, self-cleaning, charging, …)
- **Battery** level (%)
- **Washing / drying progress** levels (real-time, MQTT only)
- **Totals & history** — total run time, total clean count, last clean time and duration, self-clean / self-dry totals (diagnostic)
- **Consumables** — front/back roller brushes and filter: hours remaining, with % and minutes as attributes
- **Water level** and **suction mode**

### Binary sensors (alerts)
- Clean-water tank empty
- Detergent empty
- Dirty-water tank full / missing / needs cleaning
- Self-cleaning recommended (dirty brush/tube)
- Auto-detergent state

### Switches
- Light, auto detergent mixing, automatic rinse, automatic drying, timed dry after cleaning, custom mode

### Numbers
- Voice volume, timed-dry duration, and custom-mode settings (suction power, water flow, brush speed)

### Selects
- Traction force (light / balanced / strong)

### Buttons
- Start self-cleaning
- Start self-drying

> Some controls are *optimistic*: the device does not report their current value back, so the entity reflects the last command you sent.

Entity names are translated (English and French) and follow your Home Assistant UI language.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant **2025.1.0** or newer
- A **Dreame** account (the same one you use in the Dreamehome app) with your vacuum already added
- Network access from Home Assistant to the Dreame cloud. Known Dreame cloud endpoints supported by this integration: `eu`, `de`, `cn`, `us`, `ru`, `tw`, `sg`, `in`, `i2`, and `kr`.

Python dependencies (`pycryptodome`, `paho-mqtt`) are installed automatically by Home Assistant from the integration's `manifest.json`.

---

## Installation

### Option A — HACS (recommended)

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. In Home Assistant go to **HACS → Integrations → ⋮ (top-right) → Custom repositories**.
3. Add this repository:
   - **Repository:** `https://github.com/morcus/dreame-wet-dry-vacuum-home-assistant`
   - **Category:** `Integration`
4. Find **Dreame Wet & Dry Vacuum** in the HACS list and click **Download**.
5. **Restart Home Assistant.**

Once this repository is published to the [HACS default store](https://hacs.xyz/docs/publish/include), steps 2–3 will no longer be needed — it will be searchable directly in HACS.

### Option B — Manual

1. Copy the folder `custom_components/dreame_wet_dry_vacuum/` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. **Restart Home Assistant.**

---

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **Dreame Wet & Dry Vacuum**.
3. Enter your **Dreame account email** and **password**. The country is taken automatically from Home Assistant's configuration and is not shown as a separate field. Only if the system has no configured country is a manual country selector shown; there is no hardcoded account-country fallback.
4. Leave **Cloud server** on **Automatic** unless you need to override it manually.
5. If your account has more than one device, pick the vacuum you want to add.

In Automatic mode the integration performs one password login against a safe bootstrap backend selected from the account country (Europe for most countries). If Dreame returns the account's real `region` or `domain` in the login response, that backend is used immediately and other backends are not probed. Without authoritative backend metadata, an empty first device list permits one bounded search of the known regional device-list endpoints using the already-issued bearer token. That search is not repeated on subsequent periodic snapshots from the same client; it does **not** repeatedly submit the user's password to every server.

The cloud server and account country are deliberately separate. Dreame accounts can use a regional backend that does not match the literal ISO country code. New connections use the system country; existing stored account countries and manual server selections are preserved. Manual server choices remain available for troubleshooting.

The integration creates one device with all of its entities. State is updated in real time via MQTT, with a web poll every 5 minutes as a safety net.

### H15 Pro Heat validation profile

The consolidated **work-in-progress** test build is documented in [H15_MAPPING.md](H15_MAPPING.md). Manual installation and device validation steps in Hebrew are in [INSTALL_HE.md](INSTALL_HE.md). The diagnostic export includes version/time markers, the full mapping profile and scan differences.

This branch contains an active validation profile for the **Dreame H15 Pro Heat**
model `dreame.hold.w2449e`.

The profile is based on two sources: properties observed from the real H15 through
Dreame cloud/MQTT, and the Dreamehome app packages returned by the account for this
model (common plugin **728** plus H15 resource package **7**). Mappings are marked
as confirmed, plugin-derived, candidate, or unmapped so H14 assumptions are not
silently reused.

For H15 the coordinator now:

- scans **SIID 1-40 plus SIID 100 / PIID 1-120** during initial mapping discovery;
- performs targeted read-only `get_properties` requests for app-defined keys that
  may be absent from the cloud cache;
- exposes returned telemetry as sensors and mapped settings as selects, switches and a volume slider;
- decodes known H15 enums while preserving the exact raw value in entity attributes;
- keeps unknown properties as `Raw <siid.piid>`;
- refreshes only discovered properties during the normal five-minute safety poll;
- accepts new MQTT properties dynamically without a restart.

Current H15 mappings include battery and work mode, self-clean/dry settings and
scheduled wash/dry properties, voice volume/language identifiers, roller/filter
remaining life, personalized suction/water/cleaning/hot-water modes, GlideWheel
traction, lifting robotic-arm mode bits, and smart drying/moisture settings.

Two diagnostic buttons are available on H15:

- **Refresh mapping snapshot** — performs a fresh read-only scan and reports exact
  old/new property changes through the **Mapping changes** diagnostic sensor.
- **Export Dreame app metadata** — downloads the app plugin/resource package and
  writes a privacy-redacted `metadata_share.json` under
  `/config/dreame_h15_probe/` for mapping analysis.

Unverified H14 writable controls and H14 alert/charging decoding remain suppressed
on H15. Version work-in-progress uses the existing modules: mappings in `const.py`,
shared entity support in `entity.py`, device calls and exports in `api.py`, and
concrete entities in the existing platforms. No additional model-specific Python
files are required. H14 tables and legacy controls retain their behavior.

H15 controls include 17 selects, 17 switches and two numeric settings. These cover
cleaning/suction/water/heat settings, self-cleaning and drying modes, traction,
smart drying, detergent preferences, installed voice language, volume, and
scheduled wash/dry time and weekdays. Volume follows the app's 0/30/60 levels;
schedule time is entered in minutes after midnight with an HH:MM attribute.

Buttons start/resume/stop self-cleaning, start/stop drying, and reset roller/filter
life using actual device commands. An optional rear-brush reset is disabled when
unsupported. Two-direction app control is available as bounded 0.3-second pulses
only when the device reports horizontal and online, with an explicit stop on
failure/cancellation. Six-direction robot control is unsupported by this model.

The H15 app's warnVersion=2 tables provide 28 specific alert entities. Raw values
remain available alongside decoded warnings/errors. Water-tank conditions are
physical device telemetry, not manually reset counters. Consumable counters update
only from device readback after a reset. Unknown values are retained for mapping.

Unit tests pass; physical-device and full Home Assistant runtime validation are
still required. This work-in-progress is a draft validation build; sensor mapping remains incomplete while awaiting Dreame engineering feedback. Firmware/account management and complete cleaning-history retrieval are
outside this control build; unresolved telemetry remains diagnostic.

Properties that still have no verified H15 meaning remain visible as raw
diagnostics so they can be identified with controlled one-setting-at-a-time tests.

## HACS compatibility — what's required & what's done

For reference, here is the checklist HACS uses to validate a custom **integration** repository, and how this project meets it.

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Integration lives in `custom_components/<domain>/` | ✅ | `custom_components/dreame_wet_dry_vacuum/` |
| `manifest.json` with `domain`, `name`, `version` | ✅ | required for custom integrations |
| `manifest.json` `documentation` URL | ✅ | points to this repository |
| `manifest.json` `issue_tracker` URL | ✅ | points to the GitHub issues page |
| `manifest.json` `codeowners` | ✅ | `["@morcus"]` |
| `hacs.json` in repository root | ✅ | `name`, `content_in_root: false`, `render_readme`, `homeassistant` |
| `README.md` in repository root | ✅ | this file (`render_readme: true`) |
| `LICENSE` in repository root | ✅ | The Unlicense (public domain) |
| CI validation (HACS Action + hassfest) | ✅ | `.github/workflows/validate.yml` |
| Brand assets (`brand/icon.png`) | ✅ | local **placeholder** icon — see note below |
| Repository is **public** on GitHub | ✅ | set to *Public* |
| GitHub repository **description** is set | ✅ | set in the repo's *About* section |
| GitHub repository **topics** | ✅ | `home-assistant`, `hacs`, `dreame`, `vacuum`, … |
| At least one **release / tag** | ✅ | [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/morcus/dreame-wet-dry-vacuum-home-assistant/releases/tag/v0.1.0) |

> **Brand icon note:** `custom_components/dreame_wet_dry_vacuum/brand/icon.png` is a neutral, generated **placeholder** (a generic water-drop glyph) so the HACS *brands* check passes. It is **not** the Dreame logo. Replace it with a logo you have the rights to use, or — the recommended route — register the integration in the [home-assistant/brands](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands) repository, which both Home Assistant and HACS pick up automatically.

### Optional: getting into the default HACS store

To make the integration installable without adding it as a custom repository, submit it to the [HACS default repositories](https://hacs.xyz/docs/publish/include):

1. Ensure all ✅/⬜ items above are satisfied (public repo, description, topics, a release, and a passing structure).
2. Run the [HACS Action](https://github.com/hacs/action) and the [hassfest](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/04/16/hassfest/) checks in CI (recommended — see below).
3. Open a PR against [`hacs/default`](https://github.com/hacs/default) adding your repository.

### Recommended: validation workflows

Add GitHub Actions so HACS and Home Assistant structure are validated on every push. Create `.github/workflows/validate.yml`:

```yaml
name: Validate

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"

jobs:
  hacs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: hacs/action@main
        with:
          category: integration

  hassfest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: home-assistant/actions/hassfest@master
```

---

## Development

Unit tests (no Home Assistant install required) and linting:

```bash
pip install pytest ruff aiohttp pycryptodome "paho-mqtt>=2.0"
pytest
ruff check custom_components tests
```

Both run in CI on every push, alongside the HACS and hassfest validations.

---

## Versioning

The integration version lives in `custom_components/dreame_wet_dry_vacuum/manifest.json`. When you publish a new GitHub release, bump that version to match the release tag so HACS can track updates.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`invalid_auth`** — wrong email/password, or wrong region. Make sure you can sign in to the Dreamehome app with the same credentials.
- **`cannot_connect`** — Home Assistant cannot reach the Dreame cloud; check connectivity and the selected region.
- **`no_devices`** — the account has no compatible device. Confirm the vacuum is added to that Dreame account.
- Enable debug logging to investigate:

  ```yaml
  logger:
    default: warning
    logs:
      custom_components.dreame_wet_dry_vacuum: debug
  ```

### work-in-progress device layout and voice volume

The H15 remains one device: **Controls** for operation and preferences, **Sensors** for general telemetry, **Diagnostic** for maintenance and alerts. These are native HA headings, not custom titles. Optional raw diagnostics are disabled once on upgrade and can be re-enabled. IDs and H14 mappings are preserved. Voice volume is a three-position slider: 0 Silent, 1 Low, 2 High, sending device values 0, 30, 60. **Sensor mapping remains incomplete.** This draft build awaits Dreame engineering feedback and further physical device validation; the device-page presentation also needs further refinement.

### Work-in-progress CI and review bundles

Pushes, pull requests and manual workflow dispatch run HACS, hassfest, Ruff, component compilation and the unit-test suite on Python 3.12 and 3.13. JUnit reports are retained for 14 days, including failed runs. Only after all validation jobs pass is a commit-specific review ZIP created, containing the integration, mapping/installation documentation and tests. This is a test artifact, not a GitHub Release; no version tag or release publication occurs. Physical device testing and official confirmation of incomplete H15 mappings remain necessary before release.
